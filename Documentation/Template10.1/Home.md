# What is Template 10?

Template 10 is a set of Visual Studio project templates. They sling-shot developer productivity by getting ~80% of the boilerplate stuff delivered in the template - things like navigation, suspension, and even a Hamburger control. 

Template 10 is intended for Window XAML apps written in C#.

# Template 10 Philosophy and Other Information
## Credit where credit is due

Template 10 is the brainchild of Microsoft Developer Evangelism and was started there. Lots of learnings from Windows 8, including lots from the Pattern's and Practices Prism.StoreApps framework are in the code base.

## Why are you saying T10 is convention-based?

The philosophy is this: we want you do it our way unless you want to do it your way. You are the developer and only you know your app well enough to make big decisions. But, without a good reason to do it another way, do it our way. It's not about telling you to do it our way, it's about telling you to do it our way unless you don't want to. It's about guidance. It's about conventions. And, it's about flexibility.

**Here are some of our conventions:**

- We put views (XAML files) in a /Views folder (and ns)
- We only have one view-model for one view
- We put our view-models in a /ViewModels folder (and ns)
- We use OnNavigatedTo in view-models, not pages
- We put our models in a /Models folder (and ns)
- We often use the fa√ßade pattern with our models
- We navigate using a NavigationService
- We communicate with a Messenger
- We like Dependency Injection
- We use Template 10 ;-)

- There are [samples, many samples](https://github.com/Windows-XAML/Template10/tree/master/Samples)!

## Does Template 10 require MVVM?

No. Though it's difficult to imagine any XAML app not using model-view-view-model, there is nothing in Template 10 that requires
you to use it. Template 10 is compatible with any MVVM framework.

See the [MVVM documentation](./MVVM) for more information.

# Is Template 10 right for me?

Probably. Template 10 packs in as many time-saving lessons-learned as possible. It's perfect for new apps, or apps wanting to leverage the library. That being said, it's not for everyone (probably 90% of Windows XAML apps).
